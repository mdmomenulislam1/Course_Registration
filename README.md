1.  Add at least 3 Project features



Answer:
Any course registration web development project must include three essential components to be productive and user-friendly.

First, users must register and authenticate. This function lets users register and protect their personal data. The system will only allow permitted users, preserving sensitive data. If users forget their passwords, let them reset them using email verification or security questions.

Second, Course Management is essential for administrators to handle course data. Administrators should change a new course's name, description, credit hours, professors, and enrollment slots. Allow course updates and deletions to keep the list accurate. Improve the user experience by introducing a search and filter option to find classes by course name, instructor, and credit load.

Finally, student registration drives the system. It's reasonable that enrolled students can choose their classes. Create an easy dashboard for students to track their registrations and classes. The registration process is simplified, and students are provided clear class options.

These three elements underpin all online registrations. Even though more capabilities and improvements might be added to meet project requirements, ensuring the resilience of these core parts helps lay a solid foundation for the application's operation and usefulness.



2.  Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.



Answer:
Website development that includes automated data generation, data loading, content card creation, and shopping cart setup calls for a methodical strategy. To begin with, simulating the wanted dataset requires data generation, which may be accomplished by frameworks like Faker.js or through manual development. The website's layout and structure are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end. JavaScript is where all of the dynamic data retrieval and manipulation magic happens. The process of generating cards with data such product names, descriptions, and photographs requires retrieving created data and dynamically populating HTML layouts. You'll utilise JavaScript to handle cart data and real-time updates, allowing users to interact with the cart as they add and remove products. Before releasing the website to the public, it is essential to test it thoroughly and ensure that it is responsive. After the website is out, it should be used to guide users and undergo continual improvement based on their input.
